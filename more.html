  <ins>7. OUR LOST HOPE </ins></h1>
<p>In Kenya's vibrant land, where faith once soared high, I share a heartfelt tale, a truth that can't deny. Where shadows loom, and Christianity's voice is suppressed, The government's actions have put its rights to the test.</p>

<p>Oh, hear my words, as they paint a somber scene, Of a government's interference, where darkness convenes. Christian worship, once a beacon of hope and light, Now struggles to flourish, stifled by the government's might.</p>

<p>Condoms, they distribute, while Bibles are scarce, A narrative twisted, casting a chilling air. Promoting sexual activities, they claim to protect, But at the cost of faith, a balance they neglect.</p>

<p>Yet, amidst this turmoil, let us not despair, For the spirit of Christianity, they cannot ensnare. In the hearts of believers, faith remains unyielding, Even as the government's intentions are revealing.</p>

<p>True worship transcends boundaries, it knows no bounds, It resides in souls that rise above the earthly mounds. For in the face of adversity, the faithful will unite, Their prayers and devotion shining forth like a guiding light.</p>

<p>Let us rally together, hand in hand, we'll stand, Against forces that seek to undermine our sacred land. In unity, we'll reclaim the rights we hold dear, For Christianity's essence, undiminished, will reappear.</p>

<p>May the government's eyes be opened to the truth, That true worship brings healing, not a sense of reproof. May they recognize the importance of freedom and choice, And restore Christianity's voice with a resounding voice.</p>

<p>So, Kenya, let us rise, fueled by faith's flame, Our love for Christianity, they can never tame. With resilience and hope, we'll reclaim what is ours, And shine the light of worship, like radiant stars.</p>

<p>For in the end, the power of faith will endure, No government's actions can extinguish what's pure. Kenya's Christian souls will rise above the strife, And reclaim their rights to worship, embracing a new life</p>

 <ins>8. CORRUPTION THE MONISTER</ins></h1>

<p>Amidst the halls of power,
Where the mighty congregate,
Lurks a foul and noxious presence,
A beast we call "corruption" great.</p>

<p>It slithers through the shadows,
And festers in the light,
Infecting every institution,
With its venom and its blight.<p>

<p>Its claws have pierced the justice,
And gnawed away at law,
It's left a trail of devastation,
As it sinks its talons raw.</p>

<p>Yet hope still springs eternal,
In the heart of every soul,
That seeks to fight this evil,
And make corruption pay its toll.</p>

<p>Let us raise our voices boldly,
In the face of such deceit,
And expose the lies and treachery,
That seek to bring us defeat.</p>

<p>May we stand together strongly,
And rally to the cause,
To rid our world of corruption,
And make justice our true laws.</p>

<p>For in this fight we're united,
In our quest to set things right,
And we'll never stop striving,
Until corruption's out of sight.</p>

<p>So let us be the change we seek,
And never cease to fight,
For a world that's free of corruption,
And full of truth and light</p>

   <ins>9. KENYA ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª OUR HOME LAND </ins>
   </h1>
<p>Beneath the savannah's golden sun, Where mighty rivers flow, Lies a land of beauty and wonder, That we call Kenya, our home.</p>

<p>From the rugged peaks of Mount Kenya, To the shores of the Indian Sea, This land is rich in culture and history, And a source of pride for you and me.</p>

<p>Yet corruption has crept in quietly, And threatens to tarnish our land, As those in power seek to enrich themselves, By stealing from the nation's hand.</p>

<p>They take the fruits of our labor, And hoard them for their own gain, Leaving the masses to suffer, In poverty and pain.</p>

<p>But we will not stand idly by, As they rob us of our birthright, For Kenya is a land of heroes, And our spirit is fierce and bright.</p>

<p>We'll raise our voices high, And demand accountability, We'll fight for justice and transparency, And a Kenya that's free.</p>

<p>For we believe in a brighter future, Where corruption is no more, And the promise of Kenya's greatness, Is realized for all to adore.</p>

<p>So let us join our hands together, And pledge to never rest, Until Kenya is a beacon of hope, And corruption is laid to rest</p>

 <h1 style="font-size:28px">   THE SOUND OF FREEDOM </h1>

<p>In the depths of silence, where hearts yearn to be free, Resides a symphony, a sacred melody, A sound that echoes through the corridors of time, Unleashing grace divine, an anthem so sublime.</p>

<p>It begins with a whisper, a gentle breeze, A still, small voice that brings us to our knees. It's the hallelujahs that rise from broken souls, A chorus of redemption that makes us whole.</p>

<p>The sound of freedom in Christianity, Is more than words written in a sacred decree. It's a symphony of love, a heavenly score, That fills the air and leaves us longing for more.</p>

<p>It's the sound of chains breaking, shattered to the ground, As grace and mercy in triumph resound. It's the cry of forgiveness, reaching deep within, Setting captives free, releasing us from sin.</p>

<p>It's the sound of worship, lifting hearts on high, An offering of praise, reaching towards the sky. It's the rhythm of hope, a song that never dies, A melody of joy, lighting up our eyes.</p>

<p>It's the sound of healing, restoring broken hearts, Mending every wound, embracing every part. It's the anthem of peace, calming raging storms, A symphony of comfort that transforms.</p>

<p>It's the sound of love, unconditional and pure, A melody that's everlasting, forever to endure. It's the voice of the Savior, calling us by name, Inviting us to join in His eternal acclaim.</p>

<p>So let us raise our voices, let the sound be heard, For in the sound of freedom, every soul is stirred. Let it echo through the ages, let it resonate, A symphony of faith, a song that cannot wait.</p>

<p>For the sound of freedom in Christianity, Is a melody of grace that sets the captive free. It's a song of redemption, a love that knows no end, The sweetest sound of all, our Savior and our friend.</p>

     <ins>9.GIFT OF GOD'S LOVE</ins></h1>             

<p>In a world that values deeds and actions, Where accomplishments define our satisfaction, Let me remind you of a truth profound, That it's not by good works our salvation is found.</p>

<p>In the depths of our souls, a greater love does reside, A love that surpasses all boundaries, far and wide. For it's through the grace of God, so pure and divine, That our souls find redemption, our spirits align.</p>

<p>No amount of good works can save us alone, For it's the love of God that claims us as His own. In His mercy and compassion, we find release, A love that offers solace, granting us inner peace.</p>

<p>It's not by our own efforts, though noble they may be, But by surrendering to God's love, setting our spirits free. For in His infinite wisdom, He gave His only Son, To offer salvation, a victory that's already won.</p>

<p>So let go of striving, of trying to earn your way, And open your heart to God's love every single day. In His love, there's freedom, there's forgiveness and grace, Embracing His embrace, we find our rightful place.</p>

<p>Let the burden of good works be lifted from your soul, And let the love of God become your life's true goal. For in His boundless love, salvation truly lies, Not by good works alone, but through His love that never dies.</p>

<p>So remember, dear friend, as you journey on this path, That it's not by good works, but by love's aftermath. In the arms of God's love, our souls are truly saved, For His love knows no limits, forever to be engraved.</p>

  <ins>10.THE CRY AT CROSS</ins></h1>
<p>In the tapestry of faith, a note begins to rise, A cadence of salvation, piercing through the skies. It's the sound of freedom, a resounding chord, A symphony of grace, in which we are restored.</p>

<p>It starts with a proclamation, a truth so profound, The Word made flesh, in whom redemption is found. From the cross, a cry echoes, breaking chains of sin, The sound of freedom, as death's grip grows thin.</p>

<p>Listen closely, can you hear it in the wind? A chorus of liberation, where new life begins. It's the sound of forgiveness, a melody of grace, Erasing stains of guilt, transforming every place.</p>

<p>With every beat of our hearts, the rhythm takes flight, A symphony of hope, pushing back the night. In the stillness of surrender, we find release, As the sound of freedom brings us to our knees.</p>

<p>It resonates within us, igniting a fire, A burning passion, an unquenchable desire. It's the sound of victory, in battles we face, Empowering us to run the ultimate race.</p>

<p>For in Christ, we find freedom from all fear, A love that conquers, drawing us near. In His name, we raise our voices, strong and loud, A symphony of praise, to the One we're proud.</p>

<p>So let the sound of freedom reverberate, In every corner of the earth, breaking every gate. May it echo through the ages, an anthem of grace, A testament of faith, in every time and place.</p>

<p>For the sound of freedom in Christianity, Is a chorus of redemption, set loose and free. It's a symphony of love, where souls are set ablaze, The harmonious sound of freedom, deserving of our praise.</p>

<ins>11.CHRISTIANITY UNDERMINED  IN KENYA</ins></h1> 

<p>In Kenya, a land of vibrant diversity and faith, I raise my voice to shed light on a matter of great weight. Where Christianity, once flourishing, now faces a plight, As the government's actions cast a shadow, dimming its light.</p>

<p>Oh, hear my words, for I speak with heartfelt concern, Of a nation where Christian rights and worship burn. In the quest for power, a sinister narrative unfolds, Where dark forces reign, and Christianity's story untold.</p>

<p>Gone are the days of freedom and pure devotion, As the government's hand disrupts the faithful's emotion. Bibles are scarce, replaced by a different creed, For condoms are distributed, promoting desires that mislead.</p>

<p>Yet, let us not forget the essence of true faith, It's a bond that transcends, never meant to abate. For in the hearts of believers, hope forever resides, No government can extinguish, nor in shadows hide.</p>

<p>Though adversity may knock on Christianity's door, Its strength lies in the unwavering love it holds at its core. For the teachings of Christ inspire compassion and grace, In the face of darkness, it remains a shining embrace.</p>

<p>So let us stand together, faithful hearts intertwined, Resisting the currents that seek to redefine. For true worship knows no earthly boundaries or strife, It's a flame that burns eternal, igniting every life.</p>

<p>May the government's eyes be opened, hearts filled with light, To recognize the beauty that faith brings, day and night. Let us pray for understanding, unity, and peace, So Kenya's Christian souls find solace and release.</p>

<p>For in the midst of turmoil, hope forever prevails, And the power of prayer, no government can curtail. Rise, Kenya, with resilience and undying love, May Christianity's rights be restored, guided from above</p>
